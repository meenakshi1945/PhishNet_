PhishNet:
PhishNet is a phishing detection system designed to identify potentially malicious URLs using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on analyzing URL-based features to distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites, helping improve awareness and prevention of online fraud.

Overview:
Phishing attacks remain one of the most common cybersecurity threats, often exploiting users through deceptive links. PhishNet aims to provide a simple yet effective approach to phishing detection by leveraging data-driven models and feature extraction methods.
The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a machine learning solution, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Features:
1) URL-based phishing detection
2) Feature extraction from raw URLs
3) Machine learning model training and testing
4) Clear separation of data handling, model logic, and evaluation
5) Easy-to-understand and extensible code structure

Tech Stack:
Python,
Machine Learning (classification models),
Libraries for data preprocessing and analysis

How It Works:
1) URLs are collected and preprocessed
2) Relevant features are extracted from each URL
3) A machine learning model is trained on labeled data
4) The trained model predicts whether a URL is phishing or legitimate

Use Case:
PhishNet can be used as a foundational project for understanding phishing detection systems and can be extended into browser plugins, APIs, or larger cybersecurity applications.

Future Enhancements:
Integration with real-time URL scanning, 
Improved feature engineering,
Support for deep learning models and 
Deployment as a web or desktop application

Results and Accuracy:
The evaluation confirms that URL-based feature extraction combined with machine learning techniques provides a reliable approach for phishing detection.
